#java rest-assured sample framework
This is a simple framework that implements 2 ways of writing texts
1. BD\Gherkin-like  (test001)
2. Old school-like  (test002)

This is enough to test most REST testing tasks but...

TBD  If I have more time.
1. Change visual test reporter.
2. Support BBD Gherkin its features.
3. Rest-assured + related dependencies can eat a lot of memory (1-2 GB) per instance.
   If this is critical, it is possible to use an alternative REST library.
   But it will be another framework and another story ...  ;-)
